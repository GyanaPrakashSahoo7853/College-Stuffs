	<h1>"S = v<sub>i</sub>t+1<sub>/2</sub> at <sup>2</sup> : The Equation of LinearMotion."</h1>
	<p><b>Note:</b>: This equation was originally written 
in 1905.</p>

	<p>The formula S = vᵢt + ½at² describes the motion of an object under constant 
acceleration. Here:</P>
	<ul>
		<li><i>S</i> represents the displacement,</li>
		<li><i>vᵢ</i> is the initial velocity,</li>
		<li><i>t</i> is the time,</li>
		<li><i>a</i> is the acceleration,and</li>
		<li><i>½at²</i> is the additional displacement due to acceleration.</li>
	</ul>
	<blockquote>"An object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an external force."Highlight the phrase <u>"external force"</u> by underlining it.</blockquote>
